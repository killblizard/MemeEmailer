# MemeEmailer
Python application to email .png(really can be antything) files from a folder 

uses gmails smtp server to send mails 
Used as a meme sender in my implementation 
but there is a specific linux file and a windows file (some weird stuff was happening using the windows specific file on linux) 

Things prior to use :
you need to change src files with your email and sender emails 
you need to allow less secure apps on your gmail account to allow smtp access to gmail 



to use 
'''
python lin/winMeme.py "your password"
'''
